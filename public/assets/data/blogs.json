As the program progressed, I observed a big improvement in my son’s self-esteem and confidence. He became very comfortable in making his own decisions and was not fazed by the opinions of his peers. I also feel the personal coaching program generates goal-setting procedures, which will benefit the teenager into adulthood.</p><p>My son races motocross and advanced to the next level of competition based on experience and riding ability. A local track has a 7-night race series where the winner of their class is awarded a free entry pass for the next season. In the first race, he placed sixth. He was a little dissatisfied with that finish, but also thought he could win the series. He installed a plan, through the coaching of Jerry, which consisted of weight lifting, cardio workouts, and practice. To make a long story short, he clinched the title with one race to go. I truly feel his game plan, implemented with Jerry, made him obtain his goal. I feel grateful to have Jerry as my son’s personal coach.</p>",
